Andreas Klostermann's original description:

This is a library to interface with the Neurosky Mindwave headsets. It can
parse the binary protocol spoken by Neurosky's ThinkGear AM modules. These
modules are used in several headsets and board games, and development kits
are available from Neurosky.

This Software is licensed under the BSD License, and the authors do not
represent Neurosky.

This software is not intended to be used in medical diagnostics or medical
treatment.


Currently this software can only connect to the bluetooth version
(Mindwave Mobile), because I don't posess the other variations.
